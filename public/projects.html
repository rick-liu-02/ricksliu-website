          <h2>AnimeList Duel</h2>
          <p class="highlights">HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, MySQL</p>
          <p>
            The premise was simple: Who's wasted more time watching Japanese cartoons?
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution? A website that pits your anime-watching stats head-to-head with another user by pulling data from the website MyAnimeList.
          </p>
          <p>
            The frontend uses HTML, CSS and React, and the backend uses Node.js and MySQL.
            Inputted usernames are sent to a backend that scrapes data from various MyAnimeList pages and sends it back.
            This data is also stored in a MySQL database so future queries for the same user are much faster.
            The website still functions without the database though, just less ideally.

          <h2>CamWow!</h2>
          <p class="highlights">Python</p>
          <p>
            What if you could set up automated tasks for your computer based on hand gestures?
          </p>
          <p>
            'CamWow!' was a first-year school project made by a team of five.
            A Raspberry Pi recognizes hand gestures, including various shapes and the number of fingers, and sends this data to a computer (or multiple).
            Based on what the computer gets, certain user-specified tasks are automatically run.
            These actions can be opening computer files or opening links with optional login info, and a GUI makes customizing these things easier.
            The entire thing was made in Python, the key libraries being OpenCV, Selenium and Tkinter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, I only worked on 20% of this. Specifically, I was responsible for establishing communications between the Pi and the computer,
            implementing the ability to customize and save tasks, and creating the GUI.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still confused? Unfortunately, the source code can never see the light of day, but check out the definitely unbiased video showcasing the project.

          <h2>SoluteTaire</h2>
          <p class="highlights">Java</p>
          <p>
            I'm gonna be honest here, it's just Solitaire but everything is Chemistry-themed. Why? For the pun.
            For what it's worth though, it takes advantage of object-oriented design.
            The cards are objects, the various stacks of cards inherit from a general "stack of cards", and so on.
            The game itself was built in a game framework called libGDX.

          <h2>ASCII Art Converter</h2>
          <p class="highlights">Python</p>
          <p>
            Converts a video into ASCII art and outputs it into the console.
            Ideally it would generate a video file with sound, but I kind of abandoned it.
            The video here was manually captured with a screen recording.

          <h2>MyAnimeList Score Neural Network</h2>
          <p class="highlights">Python</p>
          <p>
            How well can a neural network predict user ratings on MyAnimeList?
          </p>
          <p>
            Quite poorly, as it turns out.
            The network was built with Keras, the high-level Tensorflow API.
            To pull data from MyAnimeList, I used a community-made API called JikanPy.
            On average, it's around 0.9 points off out of 10, but sometimes it's way off. I guess that's better than guessing randomly.

          <h2>RickBot</h2>
          <p class="highlights">Python</p>
          <p>
            A Discord bot I made for a private Discord server.
            The only real feature is the ability to generate fake messages based on specific users.
            It does this by analyzing previous chat logs and generating new text with a Markov chain.
